# Instagram Viewer Progress

Internal implementation tracker for `Instagram Viewer`.

## Current Product Direction

Build a very small local-first Instagram Saved photo viewer:

```text
Import saved_posts.json
        ↓
Extract Instagram `/p/` photo-post URLs
        ↓
Store local library in IndexedDB
        ↓
Browse + search + date filters
        ↓
Embedded photo viewer + slideshow
```

The product should remain one page unless a future requirement truly needs more.

## Privacy And Safety Rules

- [x] Ignore personal export files such as `saved_posts.json`.
- [x] Ignore `savepost.json` and common saved-post JSON filename variants.
- [x] Do not ask for Instagram username, password, 2FA, cookies, or unofficial tokens.
- [x] Do not automate crawling of Instagram Saved pages.
- [x] Do not bulk download Instagram media.
- [x] Treat the app as a local reference viewer, not a downloader.
- [x] Keep imported data out of GitHub Pages and any application backend.
- [x] Document that shared browser profiles share the same local IndexedDB.
- [x] Document Instagram iframe requests separately from local JSON processing.

## Latest Verification

- [x] `npm test` passes with 12 tests across 7 files.
- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] The Pages-specific build emits `/Instagram-Viewer/` asset paths and router basename.
- [x] Local dev server responds at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`.
- [x] `git status --ignored` shows `saved_posts.json` as ignored.
- [x] Active router only serves the one-page `HomePage`.
- [x] Active header has no navigation tabs.
- [x] Browser QA starts with exactly 20 of 45 demo records.
- [x] Scrolling automatically expands the rendered list from 20 to 40.
- [x] Browser QA confirms click selection and Next change the iframe target.
- [x] Browser QA confirms Play advances after 6 seconds and Pause stops playback.
- [x] Browser QA confirms search and date filters reduce the library.

## Next Candidate Improvements

- [ ] Add an automated direct JSON importer integration test with mocked IndexedDB.
- [ ] Consider list virtualization only if many infinite-scroll batches become slow.
- [ ] Add a timed unavailable-preview message if Instagram changes embed behavior.
- [ ] Add optional manual URL paste only if needed.
- [ ] Consider opt-in authenticated sync only as a separate, security-reviewed product phase.

## Notes

- MVP v1 was committed as `9c31a75` and pushed to `origin/main`.
- Keep imported data browser-local unless a future phase explicitly designs authentication, authorization, encryption, retention, and deletion controls.
- Keep README and PROGRESS updated after each meaningful change.
