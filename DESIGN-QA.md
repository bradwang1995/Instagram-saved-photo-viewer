## Outcome

The previous white Instagram embed and text-library split have been replaced by a full-viewport photo field. The active product name is `Instagram Viewer`. Direct source frames, when available to internal fixtures, are presented as independent media items; ordinary `saved_posts.json` imports use a bounded Instagram compatibility preview per post. Both use a virtual Horizontal View or four-column desktop Grid View. Per-card metadata, counters, source actions, and curation controls no longer compete with the photos.

The visual language follows the supplied PhotoYoshi reference: oversized expressive typography, a deep black/plum canvas, centered image objects, sparse metadata, rounded dark-edged surfaces, and motion driven by scrolling and pointer position. The implementation adapts that composition to the product workflow rather than copying PhotoYoshi content or assets.

## Combined Comparison Pass

`artifacts/photoyoshi-mobile-comparison.png` records the earlier visual-direction checkpoint. The current refinement keeps the dark low-chrome canvas and restrained motion while restoring the `Instagram Viewer` name, removing the bottom counter, and enlarging functional text.

## Required Fidelity Surfaces

- Typography: passed. One self-hosted Lobster family is computed across visible title, control, panel, form, and status text. Forced uppercase is absent; the 150% root scale remains, and the preview no longer spends image space on an oversized archive watermark or compact per-card metadata.
- Layout and spacing: passed in current browser captures. Desktop Horizontal media occupies `870px` of a `1080px` viewport. Desktop Grid shows two four-card rows while retaining one bounded four-card overscan row; mobile Grid shows two cards while retaining one bounded overscan card.
- Color and surfaces: passed. Deep black/plum backgrounds, warm off-white display text, muted gray metadata, and an Instagram-inspired orange/magenta/violet gradient replace the earlier acid-lime accent. Selected photos have no border.
- Image quality: passed. The demo uses bundled WebP photography at native aspect ratio and `object-fit: contain`. Imported unresolved Instagram sources use a square media crop that visually excludes the profile header, View more on Instagram, social actions, counts, comments, and footer. Visible cards plus the next three items may preload within a three-request concurrency gate.
- Icons and controls: passed. Lucide icons share one stroke family and remain paired with readable labels. Filter, Settings, and Slideshow use the same recognizable button construction; slideshow Previous, Play/Pause, and Next now expose visible text and equal computed dimensions.
- Copy and content: passed. The product name is `Instagram Viewer`; source/media totals, creator/collection captions, frame labels, and rejected per-card action copy are absent from the browsing surfaces.
- Responsiveness: passed in implementation, tests, and current captures. Desktop uses exactly four Grid columns; tablet uses two and mobile uses one. Both browsing modes use bounded render windows and visually hidden scrollbars. The revised dock is visible in the current `390 × 844` capture.
- Accessibility: passed for the implemented checkpoint. Semantic buttons, labels, image alt text, visible focus treatment, keyboard playback shortcuts, and reduced-motion CSS remain present. Global `user-select: none` follows the requested gallery behavior; form controls remain keyboard-operable.

## Functional Browser Evidence

- Current in-app-browser wheel input moved the horizontal ribbon from `scrollLeft 0` to `676` and selected media index `1` with scroll snap disabled.
- The original Ribbon/Index checkpoint rendered the 19-item demo; the current virtual layouts keep the full track reachable without mounting every item simultaneously.
- Creator filter reduced the session to the five `@quietframes` media items and Clear restored all 19.
- Settings exposed independent frame duration, transition duration, transition style, loop mode, and hidden-media recovery.
- Slideshow navigation advanced inside a multi-frame source before moving to the next source.
- The current slideshow frame and direct image both measured exactly `2576 × 1408` in a `2576 × 1408` viewport; controls overlay the lower edge instead of reducing the media stage.
- Opening slideshow wrote `?slideshow=1`; browser Back removed the slideshow region and restored the photo preview at the prior app URL.
- A real public compatibility embed displayed only the photo surface in Grid and slideshow captures; Instagram's header and social footer were outside the crop. Carousel arrows drawn on top of the photo can remain because the iframe is cross-origin.
- The empty-library route rendered the JSON upload composition with document dimensions matching the viewport.
- The real local-library route correctly returned the upload screen when IndexedDB contained no imported records.
- A V1 resolved-media file containing three embedded WebP images imported through the real browser file input as three ordered direct-image cards with distinct stable IDs and no iframes.
- Computed desktop controls share `19.2px` text, `52px` height, and `16px` radius; mobile controls share `16.32px`, `46px`, and `14px`. Every inspected control reports `Lobster, cursive` and `text-transform: none`.

## Iteration History

### Iteration 1

- [P1] The legacy interface devoted most of the viewport to a white Instagram embed and a shortcode/date list, contradicting the chosen dark, image-first direction.
  - Fix: replaced it with the PhotoYoshi-inspired upload composition and continuous media field.
- [P1] Post-level playback could not express multiple media frames as a single browsing sequence.
  - Fix: the resolved-media queue now expands every source frame in order and keeps source provenance as secondary metadata.
- [P2] Rendering every Instagram embed would create an unbounded iframe count for large libraries.
  - Fix: unresolved compatibility embeds mount only for real viewport intersections (plus the active Horizontal selection); resolved media uses direct image assets.
- [P2] Controls previously competed with the image and could disappear below the fold.
  - Fix: constrained media to the available viewport and reserved a fixed desktop/mobile dock.
- [P2] The library search hierarchy emphasized shortcode and time rather than recognizable people or collections.
  - Fix: filters now prioritize creator, collection, caption/tag text, and hidden state.

### Iteration 2

- [P2] Mobile required a separate visual hierarchy instead of a scaled desktop strip.
  - Fix: widened the selected frame to the safe mobile content width, simplified metadata, collapsed secondary control labels, and retained a full-width slideshow action.

### Iteration 3

- [P0] Large libraries created one Motion card per media item and the horizontal centered-item lookup scanned every card on each scroll frame.
  - Fix: both views now use layout-math virtualization. Desktop Grid mounts no more than 12 cards, and Horizontal View mounts only visible cards plus two-item overscan while using a binary centered-index lookup.
- [P0] Grid could expand to roughly eight columns on a wide screen and depended on browser lazy-load heuristics.
  - Fix: desktop Grid is exactly four columns, renders three rows at most, and immediately loads only that bounded window.
- [P1] Photos were darkened by card opacity, image filters, a shade overlay, and sibling-hover dimming.
  - Fix: all of those treatments were removed. Photos use normal filters and full opacity; hover feedback is lift, scale, border, and shadow.
- [P1] Horizontal photos occupied roughly half the viewport and `YOUR ARCHIVE` consumed the background.
  - Fix: the watermark was removed and the selected horizontal media surface now occupies 76.7% of the verified `1920 × 1080` viewport.
- [P1] UI labels were too small and the terms Ribbon/Index and INS/ARCHIVE were unclear or incorrect.
  - Fix: root text scale is 150%, visible branding is `Instagram Viewer`, and modes are `Horizontal View` and `Grid View`.
- [P1] Cards displayed creator/collection/frame labels, totals, Hide/Open Source actions, and ordinal numbers.
  - Fix: active cards now contain only the media surface and accessible selection semantics.

### Iteration 4

- [P0] Timed-out compatibility iframes released a queue permit but remained mounted, allowing stalled previews to accumulate across a virtual window.
  - Fix: timeout/error now unmounts the iframe, silently removes its card, releases the permit, and remembers the failure for later virtual remounts.
- [P1] The first desktop Grid viewport still exposed part of its second row.
  - Fix: one row now fills the scroll viewport; the following two rows remain mounted below the fold as bounded preload only.
- [P1] Earlier end-reachability evidence depended on JSDOM scroll behavior.
  - Fix: repeatable local Chrome QA now scrolls the actual Horizontal and Grid tracks to their maximum offsets and confirms demo media index 18 is mounted at the end.
- [P1] The generic JSON walk duplicated `value`/`href` URLs and interpreted `URL` as a collection while ignoring owner/caption metadata present in the real export.
  - Fix: the actual record shape is parsed atomically, preserving supported metadata and eliminating those false records.

### Iteration 5

- [P0] The media-first queue could display resolved children, but the JSON import path had no legal way to persist them and always created a single compatibility fallback.
  - Fix: added strict V1 manifest parsing plus atomic per-post replacement so every supplied child becomes an independent card.
- [P1] Array-index media IDs would lose user preferences if a resolver reordered carousel children.
  - Fix: each manifest frame now requires a stable source ID; source index controls order while the stable identity owns local preferences.
- [P1] A failed image cached only by media ID would keep a newly updated URL unavailable for the rest of the session.
  - Fix: failure and successful-candidate caches now include the current asset/preview URL revision.
- [P1] Remote media manifests can trigger browser requests to arbitrary hosts.
  - Fix: V1 accepts only public HTTPS or bounded safe image data URLs, suppresses image referrers, and documents the remote-host privacy boundary.

### Iteration 6

- [P0] A two-request concurrency queue limited simultaneous Instagram navigations but still let all 12 mounted Grid cards load sequentially.
  - Fix: DOM overscan and network permission are now separate. Grid permits only the visible row; Horizontal permits cards intersecting the real viewport plus the selected card.
- [P1] The clarified product workflow accepts only Instagram's exported Saved JSON, not a second local image package.
  - Fix: removed the local manifest-builder workflow and documented official public embeds as the selected credential-free loading path.

### Iteration 7

- [P1] Native carousel-child extraction was still described as an open release blocker after the accepted product scope changed.
  - Resolution: one ordinary saved post now intentionally maps to one card using Instagram's default first preview. Carousel-child extraction is a non-goal for this MVP.

### Iteration 8

- [P1] Private, deleted, non-embeddable, timed-out, or broken sources still occupied an error card in the visual field.
  - Fix: Meta's official tokenless oEmbed response gates known-unavailable posts, while terminal media failures report upward and collapse out of the queue without copy or counts. Transient validation failures fall back to the iframe.
- [P2] The production JavaScript was emitted as one oversized main chunk.
  - Fix: React, animation, data, and icon dependencies now build as separate cached chunks; no JavaScript chunk exceeds `234.63 kB`.

### Iteration 9

- [P0] Horizontal mouse-wheel input directly changed `scrollLeft` while CSS scroll snap pulled the viewport toward card centers, producing a sticky, jumpy feel.
  - Fix: removed snap and added bounded requestAnimationFrame easing that accepts either vertical-wheel or horizontal-trackpad deltas.
- [P0] Grid kept two extra rows mounted even though the requested preload contract was current four plus next four.
  - Fix: reduced the Grid window to two rows/eight cards and allowed the next row to enter the bounded embed queue before it reaches the viewport.
- [P1] The selected photo used an acid-green border and slideshow reused the same green accent.
  - Fix: removed the photo border and introduced the orange/magenta/violet slideshow and action gradient.
- [P1] Slideshow reserved separate header/footer rows, had no app history state, and browser Back could leave the app.
  - Fix: the frame now owns the full viewport with overlaid controls, opening pushes `?slideshow=1`, closing replaces it, and `popstate` restores the photo field. Resolved media remains `object-fit: contain`; compatibility iframes now use a viewport-safe interactive frame instead of the clipped non-interactive square.
- [P1] Re-entering a virtual window could show a loading state for a previously decoded direct image.
  - Fix: added a 96-image retained decode window, ahead-of-viewport preloading, and a cache-first image service worker for browsers that support it.
- [P2] Text selection and utilitarian type weakened the intended gallery character; the first generated cursor was subsequently reported as oversized.
  - Fix: disabled selection globally, moved display typography to a fashion-editorial serif paired with a modern system UI stack, and standardized application-controlled surfaces on one native-size default cursor. Cross-origin iframe internals remain outside parent CSS control.

### Iteration 10

- [P1] The viewer still mixed a system UI stack with a separate Bodoni/Didot display stack, so the title, tabs, dock, sheets, and slideshow did not read as one product.
  - Fix: bundled Lobster from the official Google Fonts repository and applied it as the single family across application text and controls.
- [P1] The Landing wordmark and Slideshow action still used all-caps while other labels used mixed casing, and Filter/Settings appeared as bare text rather than clear buttons.
  - Fix: changed the wordmark to title case, removed forced text transforms, and introduced one bordered, filled, rounded control treatment for tabs and actions.
- [P1] Previous/Next were `40px` icon-only squares while Play was a `52px` gradient square, making transport controls visually inconsistent and less recognizable.
  - Fix: added visible Previous/Play-or-Pause/Next labels and standardized all transport metrics; Settings, Hide, and Close use the same control language.

## Known Data Boundary

Instagram `saved_posts.json` does not contain carousel-child media, original image bytes, or reliable thumbnails. It does contain post URLs plus some owner and descriptive metadata, which the importer preserves. The only user workflow is Saved JSON; eligible posts load from Instagram through public embeds. An embed may display its own carousel, but the parent viewer cannot inspect the cross-origin iframe or flatten its children into independent native cards. The app does not scrape Instagram, request pasted credentials, or fabricate media children.

## Verification

- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm test`: 14 files and 52 tests passed, including official oEmbed availability handling, silent source omission, triple-ahead preload, per-child slideshow button/keyboard order and history, interactive iframe pausing, resolved-manifest parser regressions, transaction rollback, Grid/Horizontal end reachability, mixed-aspect viewport coverage, direct-image fallback, responsive dense Grid behavior, and iframe timeout queue draining.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Fresh local Chrome evidence confirms `24px` root text, a single Lobster family, no forced uppercase, equal per-viewport control metrics, hidden scrollbars, two visible desktop Grid rows, bounded DOM windows, an `870px` Horizontal surface, current mobile dock layout, rounded dark edges, and last-media reachability.
- Current Grid evidence mounted twelve cards: eight visible and four in the next bounded row. Horizontal kept its visible window plus three-photo side overscan. Compatibility navigation permission is limited to visible cards plus the next three, and active iframe navigation remains capped at three.
- Slideshow evidence advanced a resolved three-photo post to `03 / 03` by button then keyboard, retained the exact `5s` default, and kept the image inside `0–1080px`. Mock compatibility evidence measured an interactive focusable iframe at y=`92–988px`; focus paused playback. Cross-origin iframe child state remains intentionally unobservable.
- A controlled browser import containing two available posts and one oEmbed-rejected post retained exactly two cards/two iframes, removed the rejected card, and exposed no failure copy.
- Browser-uploaded three-photo internal fixture evidence confirms three ordered direct-image cards, stable IDs, and zero iframes at `artifacts/audit-04-manifest-grid.png`; the equal-size labeled transport is recorded at `artifacts/audit-05-slideshow-controls.png`.
- Known independent child-media records advance one frame at a time before the next post. Ordinary saved JSON still contains no carousel-child URLs; the cross-origin compatibility iframe cannot be auto-clicked or flattened by the parent viewer.

Current saved-JSON compatibility viewer and accepted MVP checkpoint: passed.
